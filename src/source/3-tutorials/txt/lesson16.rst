.. Note::

This lesson demonstrates how to write low power sensing applications in TinyOS. 
At any given moment, the power consumption of a wireless sensor node is a function of its microcontroller power state, 
whether the radio, flash, and sensor peripherals are on, and what operations active peripherals are performing. 
This tutorial shows you how to best utilize the features provided by TinyOS to keep the power consumption of applications 
that use these devices to a minimum.
