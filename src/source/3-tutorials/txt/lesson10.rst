.. Note::

Lesson 10 provides a better understanding of the difference between "make micaz" and "make telosb," 
including how these commands map into underlying files, directories, and definitions. 
It is not necessary for most TinyOS developers, but is included as a starter's guide for people who wish 
to understand the make system better or wish to design a new platform.
