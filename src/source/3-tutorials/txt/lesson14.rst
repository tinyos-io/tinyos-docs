.. Note::

Lesson 14 goes through the process of building a simple anti-theft application using many of the features and services of TinyOS 2. 
Lesson 14 is found in the tinyos-2.x/apps/AntiTheft directory. 
The powerpoint slides found there (also available in pdf form) go over the basic principles of TinyOS, 
and show how to build the accompanying AntiTheft application. Please start by reading the README.txt file in the AntiTheft directory.
To run the AntiTheft demo you will need mica2 or micaz motes, and some mts310 sensor boards (you can also use mts300 boards, 
though you will lose the movement detection functionality). 
If you do not have this hardware, the slides and AntiTheft code should still provide a good overview of TinyOS 2.
